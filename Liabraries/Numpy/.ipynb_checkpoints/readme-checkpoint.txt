## Introduction

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library for numerical computations and handling large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. It provides a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on arrays and is widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing.

## Installation

To install NumPy, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install numpy

```

## Usage

Here's a simple example to get you started with NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)

# Perform an operation
print("Sum:", np.sum(arr))
```

## Key Concepts

### Arrays

NumPy arrays are the core data structure. They are similar to Python lists but offer more functionality and better performance for numerical operations.

```python
# Creating arrays
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
```

### Array Operations

NumPy supports element-wise operations, aggregation, and more.

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
print(a + b)  # [5 7 9]
print(a * b)  # [ 4 10 18]
```

### Indexing and Slicing

You can access and modify array elements using indexing and slicing.

```python
arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40])
print(arr[1:3])  # [20 30]
```

### Broadcasting

Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes.

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = 2
print(a * b)  # [2 4 6]
```
